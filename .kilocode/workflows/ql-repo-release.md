## Purpose

Orchestrate the full local release workflow after `/ql-substantiate` seals a session. Transitions substantiated deliverables to production-ready releases with confirmation gates at every irreversible step.

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Verify Branch and Seal

#### Branch Gate

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

The release branch must follow the naming convention `hotfix/vX.Y.Z` or `release/vX.Y.Z`.

If on a feature branch (e.g., `feat/*`, `plan/*`):

```
ABORT
Report: "Cannot release from a feature branch. Create a release or hotfix branch first:
  git checkout -b hotfix/vX.Y.Z   (from the branch with all changes)
  git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z  (from main after merging)"
```

If on `main`:

```
WARN: "Direct push to main is blocked by pre-push policy. Switching to release branch."
git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z
```

#### Pull Latest

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

**Note**: After release, create a PR to merge the release/hotfix branch into `main`.

#### Seal Check

```
Read: docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md
Read: docs/META_LEDGER.md (last entry)
```

Confirm the latest ledger entry is a SUBSTANTIATE seal. If not:

```
ABORT
Report: "No seal found. Run /ql-substantiate before releasing."
```

### Step 2: Run Pre-Flight

Execute `release-gate.cjs --preflight` from `FailSafe/extension/`:

```bash
node scripts/release-gate.cjs --preflight
```

Additionally, verify:

#### Skill files uncommitted check

```bash
git diff --name-only -- .claude/commands/ql-*.md
```

If any skill files are modified but not committed, warn:

> Skill files modified but uncommitted: [list]. Include in release commit or stash before proceeding.

#### Help doc version markers

Read `FailSafe/extension/docs/COMPONENT_HELP.md` and `FailSafe/extension/docs/PROCESS_GUIDE.md`. Verify version markers match the target release version. If stale, flag for update in Step 5.

#### Backlog coherence

```
Read: docs/BACKLOG.md
```

Verify:

1. **No duplicate B-item numbers** â€” scan all `[B###]` references for collisions
2. **Version summary table is current** â€” the latest released version appears in the table with correct status
3. **No backlog items reference a version older than the current release as PLANNED/IN PROGRESS** â€” flag stale version targets

Report any issues. If any pre-flight check fails, report which checks need attention and STOP.

### Step 3: Confirm Version Bump

Read current version from `FailSafe/extension/package.json`.

Ask the user:

> Current version is **vX.Y.Z**. What bump level? (patch / minor / major)

Wait for response before proceeding.

### Step 4: Apply Version Bump

Execute:

```bash
node scripts/release-gate.cjs --bump <level>
```

Report: `vX.Y.Z -> vA.B.C (<level> bump)`

### Step 5: Author Release Metadata

Invoke `/ql-document` in RELEASE_METADATA mode with the target version:

1. Read recent META_LEDGER entries (from last DELIVER or SUBSTANTIATE to current)
2. Read SYSTEM_STATE.md for implementation summary
3. Author the 3 required files:
   - `FailSafe/extension/CHANGELOG.md` â€” `## [A.B.C] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   - `FailSafe/extension/README.md` â€” Current Release + What's New
   - Root `CHANGELOG.md` â€” `## [A.B.C]`
4. Present authored content to user for review before writing

**Confirmation gate** â€” Show authored content. User approves or edits before files are written.

### Step 6: Re-Run Pre-Flight

Execute `release-gate.cjs --preflight` again to verify all markers are in place.

If any check fails, report and let the user fix. Do not proceed until all pass.

### Step 7: Stage and Commit

**Confirmation gate** â€” Show the user the diff:

```bash
git diff --stat
```

Ask: "Stage and commit these changes as `[RELEASE] vA.B.C`? (y/n)"

If confirmed:

```bash
git add -f FailSafe/extension/package.json FailSafe/extension/CHANGELOG.md FailSafe/extension/README.md FailSafe/extension/docs/COMPONENT_HELP.md FailSafe/extension/docs/PROCESS_GUIDE.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "[RELEASE] vA.B.C"
```

Note: `-f` is required because `FailSafe/extension/docs/` is in `.gitignore` but tracked.

### Step 8: Create Tag

Execute:

```bash
node scripts/release-gate.cjs --tag
```

This runs preflight internally and creates an annotated git tag.

### Step 9: Confirm Push

**Confirmation gate** â€” Present:

> Tag **vA.B.C** created locally. Push to origin to trigger the release pipeline?
>
> Remote: origin
> Branch: current branch
> Tag: vA.B.C
>
> Proceed? (y/n)

If confirmed:

```bash
git push && git push --tags
```

### Step 10: Record Ledger

Add META_LEDGER entry:

```markdown
### Entry #[N]: DELIVER â€” vA.B.C

**Timestamp**: [ISO 8601]
**Phase**: DELIVER
**Author**: Governor

**Version**: A.B.C
**Tag**: vA.B.C
**Commit**: [short hash]

**Decision**: Release vA.B.C delivered. Tag pushed to trigger release pipeline.
```

Calculate and record content hash and chain hash per standard Merkle chain protocol.

## Confirmation Gates

Two irreversible actions require explicit user confirmation:

1. **Before commit** â€” Shows diff summary
2. **Before push** â€” Shows tag + remote target

## Constraints

- **NEVER** push without user confirmation
- **NEVER** write metadata without user review of authored content
- **NEVER** release without a preceding SUBSTANTIATE seal
- **NEVER** skip the pre-flight validation
- **NEVER** release from a feature branch â€” must be on `main`
- **NEVER** tag without pulling latest `main` first
- **ALWAYS** use `/ql-document` for release metadata authoring
- **ALWAYS** run pre-flight twice (before and after metadata authoring)
- **ALWAYS** use `[RELEASE] vX.Y.Z` commit message format
- **ALWAYS** record the delivery in META_LEDGER
- **ALWAYS** update version markers in `docs/COMPONENT_HELP.md` and `docs/PROCESS_GUIDE.md`
- **ALWAYS** verify `docs/BACKLOG.md` version summary table is current before releasing
- **ALWAYS** use `git add -f` for gitignored-but-tracked paths (e.g., `FailSafe/extension/docs/`)
